#RemoteH

RemoteH is a frontend for reverse VNC connections. It is meant to be a simple two-step process that connects one person to another's screen.

It is based on Gitso. The original project is kept at: https://code.google.com/p/gitso/

The main changes are:

+ Internationalization and localization support
+ Changed the interface from wxWidgets to TkInter, which also fixed the interface in Linux (some elements where put outside the window)
+ Now deletes the text in the address entry when the user clicks on it
